What is the policy for late assignment submissions in this class?

> For lab assignments, you will have two (2) slip days which can be used however you see fit over the entire semester.  For example, you can turn in one assignment two days late, or two assignments one day late each, without penalty.
Beyond slip days, late assignments will incur a 20% point reduction for each additional day late.  No assignment will be accepted more than 5 days after the due date.

Exceptions to the above may be granted in case of emergencies, but contact the instructor as soon as possible.LLlllllll
