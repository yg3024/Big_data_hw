Once the assignment link is accessed, you will automatically be able to access your individual version of this repository.

### Students are required to do the following in order to get full credit:
1. Clone the repository to the local machine.
2. Identify yourself: Open the `Identify.txt` file and enter your name, netid, and NYU email address.
3. Add/move files:
    1. Create a new file named `hello-world.txt` and commit it to the repo.
    2. Create a new directory named `Hello` and move `hello-world.txt` into that directory. 
    3. Finally commit the changes in the previous step.
4. Branching:
    1. Create a new branch of the repository.
    2. Edit the file `V.txt` as per the question asked in that file.
    3. Commit the changes and merge that branch into the main branch.

### Notes:
1. Please make sure to follow the instructions in the README.md file as provided, as we'll be looking at the git log file for grading the assignment.
2. Your NYU NetID is usually your initials followed by numbers (e.g., bm106).  It is *not* your N-number.
3. This is an individual assignment, to be completed by each student separately.
4. It is important to use descriptive commit messages whenever you make a commit. This is one of the things that will be considered while grading. Try to make them short, specific and descriptive.
5. Please make sure to upgrade to the latest version of [git](https://git-scm.com/) (at least version 2.39.1).
